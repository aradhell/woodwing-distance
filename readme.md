### Goal 
Make a web service that accepts two distances (numbers) and returns the total distance (sum of both).
### Prerequisites
Implement a RESTful web service in PHP with (or without) any framework of your choice.
Specifications: For each of the two distances, the requester can specify a unit, either Meters or Yards.

Also for the returned total distance, the requester must specify a unit as well.
For example, the request could be 3 Yards + 5 Meters = ... Meters, and the response would be 7.73 Meters.

### Requirements
* [PHP ^7.1.3](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md)

### Installation
```
git clone woodwing-distance.bundle -b master
```
```
cd woodwing-distance
```
```
cp .env.example .env
```
```
composer install
```
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
```
http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### Planning
1 yard = 0.9144 meter

1 meter = 1 meter

Distance unit value in base unit never change, so I can keep them in unit object itself and I can also do the conversion from base unit value to value in unit object.

- I will create a Calculator to take 2 params;

distancesToCalculate and outputUnitType

- To pass request and get related calculation result, I will create a Service class. 
----
